Am I gonna be a star?\n\nI tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl\nI tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best\nI guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song\nThis type of modern life - is it for me?\nThis type of modern life - is it for free?\n\nSo I went in to a bar, looking for sympathy\nA little company - I tried to find a friend\nIt's more easily said, it's always been the same\nThis type of modern life is not for me\nThis type of modern life is not for free\n\nAmerican life (American life)\nI live the American dream (American dream)\nYou are the best thing I've seen\nYou are not just a dream (American life)\n\nI tried to stay ahead, I tried to stay on top\nI tried to play the part, but somehow I forgot\nJust what I did it for and why I wanted more\nThis type of modern life - is it for me?\nThis type of modern life - is it for free?\n\nDo I have to change my name? Will it get me far?\nShould I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?\n\nAmerican life (American life)\nI live the American dream (American dream)\nYou are the best thing I've seen\nYou are not just a dream (American life)\n(American life)\n\nI tried to be a boy, tried to be a girl\nTried to be a mess, tried to be the best\nTried to find a friend, tried to stay ahead\nI tried to stay on top...\n\nFuck it!\nDo I have to change my name? Will it get me far?\nShould I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?\nOh, fuck it!\nOh, fuck it!\nOh, fuck it!\nOh, fuck it!\n\nI'm drinking a soy latte,\nI get a double shotte, it goes all through my body,\nAnd you know I'm satisfied\nI drive my Mini Cooper\nAnd I'm feeling super-dooper\nYo they tell me I'm a trooper\n\nAnd you know I'm satisfied\nI do yoga and pilates\nAnd the room is full of hotties\nSo I'm checking out the bodies\nAnd you know I'm satisfied\n\nI'm digging on the isotopes\nThis metaphysics shit is dope\nAnd if all this can give me hope\nYou know I'm satisfied\n\nI got a lawyer and a manager\nAn agent and a chef\nThree nannies, an assistant\nAnd a driver and a jet\n\nA trainer and a butler\nAnd a bodyguard or five\nA gardener and a stylist\nDo you think I'm satisfied?\n\nI'd like to express my extreme point of view\nI'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew\nI'm just living out the American dream\nAnd I just realised that nothing\nIs what it seems\n\nDo I have to change my name?\nAm I gonna be a star?\nDo I have to change my name?\nAm I gonna be a star?\nDo I have to change my name?", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Madonna"}
