{"name": "Live to Tell", "writers": ["Madonna", "Patrick Leonard"], "year": "1986\n", "lyrics": "I have a tale to tell\nSometimes it gets so hard to hide it well\nI was not ready for the fall\nToo blind to see the writing on the wall\n\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me\n\nI know where beauty lives\nI've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives\nThe light that you could never see\nIt shines inside you - can't take that from me\n\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me\n\nThe truth is never far behind\nYou've kept it hidden well\nIf I live to tell the secret I knew then\nWill I ever have the chance again?\n\nIf I'd run away\nI'd never have the strength to go very far\nHow would they hear the beating of my heart?\nWill it grow cold, the secret that I hide? \nWill I grow old?\nHow will they hear?\nWhen will they learn?\nHow will they know?\n\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me\n\nThe truth is never far behind\nYou've kept it hidden well\nIf I live to tell the secret I knew then\nWill I ever have the chance again?\n\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Madonna"}
