{"name": "The Look of Love", "writers": ["Madonna", "Patrick Leonard"], "year": "1987\n", "lyrics": "Should have left you standing right where you stood\nShould have let you go, should have had the sense to know\nLike a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place\nNow I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\nFrom the look of love, from the eyes of pride\nNowhere to go, no place to run\nFrom the look of love, now I've come undone\n\nI've had a map laid out from the day I was born\nBut the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn\nAnd all the books I've read, and the things I know\nNever taught me to laugh, never taught to let go\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\nFrom the look of love, from the eyes of pride\nNowhere to go, no place to run\nFrom the look of love, now I've come undone\n\nMy conscience is clear I know right from wrong\nThat's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone\nBut there's more to learn from the look in your eyes\nThat trip round this world, the stars in the sky\n\nNow all the books I've read, and the things I know\nNever taught me to live, never taught me to let go\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\nFrom the look of love, from the eyes of pride\nNowhere to go, no place to run\nFrom the look of love, now I've come undone\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\nFrom the look of love, Lord knows I've tried\nNowhere to go, no place to run\nFrom the look of love, now I've come undone\n\n(Nowhere to hide)\n(No place to run)\n(Nowhere to hide)\n(No place to run)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Madonna"}
