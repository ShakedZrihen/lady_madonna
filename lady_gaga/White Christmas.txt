{"name": "White Christmas", "writers": ["Irving Berlin"], "year": "2011\n", "lyrics": "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the one I used to know\nWhere the tree tops glisten and children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow, oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nI'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\n\nOh \u044cay your days be so very merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\n\nI'm dreaming of a white Snowman\nWith the carrot nose and charcoal eyes\nAnd oh when he cries I'm gonna tell him\nIt's okay\nBecause Santa's on his sleigh and on his way\n\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nSo may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Lady_Gaga"}
